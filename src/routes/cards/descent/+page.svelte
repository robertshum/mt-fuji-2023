      The initial trek was very forgiving.Â  Very flat surface but it was pouring
      rain.

      There were waves of hikers coming back from the hike, presumably the
      morning crowd where they saw the sunrise.Â  It was kind of funny and sad at
      the same time, looking at their facial expressions... they all looked
      exhausted and fatigued!
