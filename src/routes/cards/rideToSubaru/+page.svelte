    <h2>August 23rd, 2023</h2>
    <p>
      From my hotel to Fujisan bus station was a 3min walk, and then getting to
      the 5th station was easy! It's one bus that goes to the 5th station with
      stops along the way.
    </p>
    <ProTip
      tip="If you want a seat on the bus, line up just before 6am at Fujisan
    station.Â  Otherwise it might be full by the time you get to Kawaguchiko."
