      I decided to leave a day before the hike as that gives me more time to
      pack, purchase any food, and do any last minute preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was to stay at a hotel close by the bus station where the bus
      would come early in the morning and drive us directly toÂ Fuji Subaru Line
      5th Station.

        To buy the tickets to Mt Fuji Station, which was close to my hotel, we
        have to go to Busta Shinjuku, which was across the street from Shinjuku
        station.
