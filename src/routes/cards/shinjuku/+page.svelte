    <h2>August 22nd, 2023</h2>
    <p>
      I decided to leave a day before the hike as that gives me more time to
      pack, purchase any food, and do any last minute preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was to stay at a hotel close by the bus station where the bus
      would come early in the morning and drive us directly toÂ Fuji Subaru Line
      5th Station.
