### Caching

#### Storing images in src/lib vs static folders

Any files stored under src, VITE will mark images with a hash which allows to cache it for a very long time in the browser.  Static does not have the hash added.

### Root Elements when stacking HTML Figures

For some reason if I stack custom components (See CardImage) where the root element is a HTML Figure, it hides the last figure.  (The figure shows up on the DOM but the height is set to 0).  It might be sveltekit's way of conditional rendering of certain elements on the dom.

Example: if I have 3 card images, the first 2 will show.  If I have 4, it shows the first 3.

A 'fix' is use a div, or any other root element, to wrap around the Figure.





*This is a SvelteKit project adding the needle-engine web component* 

â†’ [**Live demo**](https://needle-engine.github.io/sveltekit-sample/) automatically build and deployed via github actions

## Needle Engine Configuration

- [`needle.config.json`](./needle.config.json)  
  Added the `baseUrl` config to `assets` to change codegen (`src/generated/gen`) to point to the local server relative url
- [`svelte.config.js`](./svelte.config.js)  
  Defines `paths.base` for deployment.  
  Uses `adapter-static` currently to produce static pages that can be uploaded anywhere. Adjust it for your needs.


## Github Pages Instructions
To use github pages go to [Settings/Pages](settings/pages) and set the **Build and Deployment** source to *Github Actions*. Now you can push new versions to this repository to trigger an automatic build and deployment action to be hosted on github pages. A deployment can also be triggered manually on the [Deployment Action page](./actions/workflows/deploy.yml)
